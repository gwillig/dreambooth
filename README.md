The following Notebook shows some experience with dreambooth. To goal was to create images which could be used on LinkedIn or for a CV.

Results are quite underwhelming.
I used a round one hundred images of myself for the fine-tuning. Below you can see an example for the training data.<br>

# Experimence 

## 1. Feeding the raw training data into fine-tuning
The result was:
* <img src="traing_data_with_bg.png" width="324">
Prompt: profile_LinkedIn profile of gustav person in a suit <br>
<img src="2_profile_LinkedIn profile of gustav person in a suit.png" width="324"><br>
<br>
Prompt: profile_ clean shaved gustav person <br>
<img src="3_profile_ clean shaved gustav person.png" width="324"><br>
<br>
## 1. Preprocessing the images so that the background is removed
