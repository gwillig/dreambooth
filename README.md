The following Notebook shows some experience with dreambooth. To goal was to create images which could be used on LinkedIn or for a CV.

Results are quite underwhelming.
I used a round one hundred images of myself for the fine-tuning. Below you can see an example for the training data.<br>

<img src="training_image.jpg" width="324">

The result was:
* <img src="traing_data_with_bg.png" width="324">

Removing the background of the image did not improve the result (see the below examples): <br>
<br><img src="traing_data with_no_bg_2.png" width="324"><br>
<img src="traing_data with_no_bg_1.png" width="324"><br>
